    "# Word Count with MapReduce - Lab\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have seen the key map and reduce operators in Spark, and also know when to use transformation and action operators, we can revisit the word count problem we introduced earlier in the section. In this lab, we will read a text corpus into the Spark environment, perform a word count, and try basic NLP ideas to get a good grip on how MapReduce performs. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab you will:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Apply the map(func) transformation to a given function on all elements of an RDD in different partitions \n",
    "* Apply a map transformation for all elements of an RDD \n",
    "* Compare the difference between a transformation and an action within RDDs \n",
    "* Use collect(), count(), and take() actions to trigger spark transformations \n",
    "* Use filter to select data that meets certain specifications within an RDD \n",
    "* Use Spark and the MapReduce framework to complete a full parallelized word count problem \n",
    "\n",
    "## Word Count Task\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is what our problem looks like:\n",
    "\n",
    "* We have a huge text document\n",
    "* We need to count the number of times each distinct word appears in the document\n",
    "\n",
    "Sample applications:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Analyze web server logs to find popular URLs\n",
    "* Analyze texts for content or style "

    "## Word Count with MapReduce\n",
    "\n",
    "We will illustrate a MapReduce computation for counting the number of occurrences for each word in a text corpus. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, the data consists of a directory `text/` containing `.txt` documents. These documents each contain the full text of a work by either William Shakespeare or Jane Austen.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our analysis we'll count the frequency of words for __style identification__ as word frequencies might have unique features which can potentially describe the author's writing style. We'll walk through the steps one by one, then write a function at the end that allows us to compare the different authors.\n",
    "\n",
    "MapReduce in PySpark provides a practical and efficient way of achieving this goal as it: \n",
    "\n",
    "* works if the file is too large for memory,\n",
    "* works even if the output is too large for memory, and\n",
    "* is naturally parallelizable\n"

    "### MapReduce Framework\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the steps that we will perform for our problem, under the MapReduce framework:  \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Sequentially read a lot of data\n",
    "   * From a text file in this case\n",
    "2. **Split:** Split the data into chunks that can be analyzed separately\n",
    "   * In this case, each line of the text file becomes a record in an RDD\n",
    "3. **Map:** Perform any relevant transformations\n",
    "   * We'll be splitting each line into words, making the words lowercase, and removing punctuation\n",
    "4. **Shuffle:** Group by key in preparation for reducing\n",
    "   * In this case, we want to group by the cleaned word\n",
    "   * Spark does this for us automatically; we just need to invoke the Reduce step\n",
    "5. **Reduce:** Aggregate, summarize, filter, or sort\n",
    "   * We'll aggregate the frequencies, filter by frequency as well as by specific stopwords, and end by sorting by frequency\n",
    "6. Write the result\n",
    "   * Our final result will be a list of tuples containing the top 10 words and their frequencies\n",

    "In this exercise, we saw MapReduce in action for solving a basic NLP task, i.e. counting the frequency of stop words and keep words of a text corpus. This exercise can be seen as a first step towards text analytics on big data platforms. After this lab, we will get into more advanced use cases of PySpark, specifically for machine learning applications. "
